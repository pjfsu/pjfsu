Hi! Hola! Ola!

My name is Pedro.

I was born in Perú and I was a teenager I moved to Galicia, Spain (Olé!).

Last September 2024 I obtained my master's degree in computer engineering from the University of Uvigo.

I'm interested in GNU/Linux Information Systems because GNU/Linux programs are almost everywhere.

I am currently preparing for the LPIC-1 and PET exams.
